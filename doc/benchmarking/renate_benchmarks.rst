Renate Benchmarks
*****************

Renate features a variety of :ref:`models <benchmarking-renate-benchmarks-models>`,
:ref:`datasets <benchmarking-renate-benchmarks-datasets>` and :ref:`scenarios <benchmarking-renate-benchmarks-scenarios>`.
This allows for evaluating the different Renate updaters on many standard benchmarks.
In the following, we describe how to combine the different components to your very own benchmark.
Independent of the benchmark, they all are started via :py:func:`~renate.benchmark.experimentation.execute_experiment_job`.
The function call below demonstrates the simplest setup where the benchmark is run locally.
The benchmark will be configured by :code:`config_space`.

.. code-block:: python

    from renate.benchmark.experimentation import execute_experiment_job, experiment_config_file

    execute_experiment_job(
        backend="local",
        config_file=experiment_config_file(),
        config_space=config_space,
        experiment_outputs_url="results/",
        mode="max",
        metric="val_accuracy",
        num_updates=5,
    )

Models
======

You can select the model by assigning the corresponding name to :code:`config_space["model_name"]`.
For example, to use a ResNet-18 model, you use

.. code-block:: python

    config_space["model_name"] = "ResNet18"

Each model may have independent arguments.
The ResNet-18 model requires to define the number of outputs.

.. code-block:: python

    config_space["num_outputs"] = 10

Datasets
========

Similarly, you select the dataset by assigning the corresponding name to :code:`config_space["dataset_name"]`.
For example, to use the CIFAR-10 dataset with 10% of the data used for validation, you use

.. code-block:: python

    config_space["dataset_name"] = "CIFAR10"
    config_space["val_size"] = 0.1

.. _benchmarking-renate-benchmarks-scenarios:

Scenarios
=========

A scenario defines how the dataset is split into several data partitions.
While running the benchmark, the model is trained sequentially on each data partition.
The scenario can be selected by setting :code:`config_space["scenario_name"]` accordingly.
Each scenario might have specific settings which require additional changes of :code:`config_space`.
We will describe those settings in the table below.

The following is an example that uses the class-incremental scenario which splits the entire dataset into 2 parts.
The first part contains all instances with classes 1 and 2, the second with classes 3 and 4.

.. code-block:: python

    config_space["scenario_name"] = "ClassIncrementalScenario"
    config_space["class_groupings"] = ((1, 2), (3, 4))

.. list-table:: Renate Scenario Overview
    :widths: 15 35 35
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Scenario Name
      - Description
      - Settings
    * - :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.BenchmarkScenario`
      - Used in combination only with CLEAR-10 or CLEAR-100.
      - * :code:`num_tasks`: Number of data partitions.
    * - :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.WildTimeScenario`
      - Used in combination only with Wild-Time datasets. This is not the scenario used in the paper.
        Data is presented time step by time step and the model is evaluated on test data up to the
        current time step.
      - * :code:`num_tasks`: Number of data partitions.
    * - :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.ClassIncrementalScenario`
      - Creates data partitions by splitting the data according to class labels.
      - * :code:`class_groupings`: Tuple of tuples containing the class labels, e.g., ``((1, ), (2, 3, 4))``.
    * - :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.FeatureSortingScenario`
      - Splits data into different tasks after sorting the data according to a specific feature.
        Can be used for image data as well. In that case channels are selected and we select according to
        average channel value.
        Random permutations may be applied to have a less strict sorting.
      - * :code:`num_tasks`: Number of data partitions.
        * :code:`feature_idx`: The feature index used for sorting.
        * :code:`randomness`: After sorting, ``0.5 * N * randomness`` random pairs in the sequence are swapped where
          ``N`` is the number of data points. This must be a value between 0 and 1. This allows for creating less strict
          sorted scenarios.
    * - :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.HueShiftScenario`
      - A specific scenario only for image data. Very similar to
        :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.FeatureSortingScenario` but this scenario sorts according to the hue
        value of an image. Sorting can be less strict by applying random permutations.
      - * :code:`num_tasks`: Number of data partitions.
        * :code:`randomness`: After sorting, ``0.5 * N * randomness`` random pairs in the sequence are swapped where
          ``N`` is the number of data points. This must be a value between 0 and 1. This allows for creating less strict
          sorted scenarios.
    * - :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.IIDScenario`
      - Divides the dataset uniformly at random into equally-sized partitions.
      - * :code:`num_tasks`: Number of data partitions.
    * - :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.ImageRotationScenario`
      - Creates data partitions by rotating the images by different angles.
      - * :code:`degrees`: Tuple of degrees, e.g., ``(45, 90, 180)``.
    * - :py:class:`~renate.benchmark.scenarios.PermutationScenario`
      - Creates data partitions by randomly permuting the input features.
      - * :code:`num_tasks`: Number of data partitions.
        * :code:`input_dim`: Data dimensionality (tuple or int as string).

Example: Class-incremental Learning on CIFAR-10
===============================================

The following example reproduces the results shown in
`Dark Experience for General Continual Learning: a Strong, Simple Baseline <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07211>`_
Table 2, Buffer 500, S-CIFAR-10, Class-IL, DER++.
These settings use a class-incremental scenario in which the CIFAR-10 dataset is partitioned into 5 parts, each
containing two unique classes.
Dark Experience Replay++ is used as the updating method with a memory buffer size of 500
and the experiment is repeated 10 times.
